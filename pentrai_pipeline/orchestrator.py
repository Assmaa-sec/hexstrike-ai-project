"""
The orchestrator wires the stages together in order and owns the two things that
must never be skipped: **teardown** of the sandbox (in a finally block, even on
error) and **event emission** so the eventual web layer can stream progress.

The control flow here is the whole pipeline at a glance. The stages it calls are
still stubs (they raise NotImplementedError); this file is intentionally complete
so the skeleton is genuinely *wired* and each stage can be filled in independently.
